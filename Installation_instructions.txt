1. Install composer if it is not already installed on your local machine 
    $ brew install composer

2. Once you have composer installed locally, clone the drupal-project repository into your local machine

    $ git clone https://github.com/sasankaj/d8_sandbox.git d8_sandbox

3. Navigate to the new d8_sandbox directory and 

 - If you want to change the site parameters, change the following files
    site name, db name, db user, db password, db port no. in -
        .docksal/docksal-local.env
        docroot/sites/default/settings.local.php

    site url in -
        tests/backstop/backstop-settings.js
        tests/backstop/backstop.json
        tests/behat/behat.yml

    metadata about site in -    
        tests/behat/composer.json
        composer.json

    increase your php and mysql memory allocation in -
        .docksal/etc/php/php.ini, 
        .docksal/etc/mysql/my.cnf 

4. From the d8sandbox directory, install all project dependencies using composer.

    $ cd d8_sandbox
    $ composer install

5. If your docksal vm is not already started, run this command, other wise skip to next step
    $ fin vm start


6. start the project by running fin start up (up forces docksal to re-read the configuration)

    $ fin start up


7. At this point you have your drupal site ready for installation. You can either import the database for a vanilla drupal installation from 
the database_dumps directory (step 7a.) or go through the site setup process (Step 7b.).

    7a. go to mysql console,  check if database d8_sandbox is already created. If it is, then grant all privileges on this db to d8_user

        $ fin db cli
        mysql> create database d8_sandbox;
        mysql> Grant all privileges on d8_sandbox.* to d8_user;


    7b. go to http://d8sandbox.docksal in your browser. Use the following db configuration for installing d8 site 

        database name : d8_sandbox
        database username: d8_user
        database password: password
        hostname: db
        port number: 3306


        Site name: D8 Sandbox
        Site email address: <your_email_id@domain.com>
        site maintenance account: 
        username: admin
        password: password
        Default Country: United States
        timezone: New York
